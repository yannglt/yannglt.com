            <p>My name is Yann-Edern Gillet. I’m a French designer living in Paris, France. My main area of focus today is on systems, digital products and interfaces. DMs are opened!</p>

            <p>In my spare time I still spend a lot of time on screens, but more as a front-end engineer. I love learning new things, especially with Vue, Nuxt and GSAP. More recently I’m learning the craft of icon design (yup, the ones you saw earlier are born on my computer). I like the idea of crafting myself every pixel of my creations, both in design and code, like this portfolio.</p>

            <p>When my hands are not on my mechanical keyboard, I enjoy taking care of my plants, cook/ try some italian recipes with my girlfriend and building LEGO sets.</p>
            <p>To relax, I dive into work of others designers and developers, thanks to Standards Manual, Increment and Offscreen.</p>
            <!-- <p>With this COVID—19/20/21 crisis + global lockdown, I spent a lot of time improving my workspace and discovered myself quite a passion for that (how original). Interested in learning more about my setup ?</p>

            <p>I’m also a huge fan of Hip-Hop culture and music. Even if I listen to a lot of US / UK rappers, french rap is deeply anchored in my head + easier to understand as a french person of course. I created playlists for each of my mood, feel free to give it a try!</p>
